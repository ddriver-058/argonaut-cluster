  Rename existing scripts to indicate no use of typescript (can leave config the same to ensure forwards-compatibility)
  Complete!
Playbook security
  Use ansible | quote() filter whenever possible, validate unquoted inputs.
  Instead of quoting, validate variables via the assert task type. 
  For directories, you can use stat.path task in ansible + assert to ensure the path exists.
  You can use this regexp to test for a valid hostname:
    ^(([a-zA-Z0-9]|[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9\-]*[a-zA-Z0-9])\.)*([A-Za-z0-9]|[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9\-]*[A-Za-z0-9])$
  Then, arguments can be tested like so:
    ^--provision|--no-provision$
